# List of changes V2.4
- Fix test runner windows
- Updated to webpack 3
- Use .dockerignore to increase speed of building Docker image (no need to copy files to Docker build context).
- Use npm@6 and add package-lock.json.
- Update versions of nodejs used for testing in Travis (only LTS / actively maintained versions - no more node@4!!).
- Use a single Dockerfile w/ build targets, to greatly speed up building of Docker image.
- Swap default Docker environment from production to development, to improve DX.
- Eliminate production-mode inclusion of devDependencies, to keep production Docker image as light as possible and lower production-mode memory usage.
- Explicitly volume-map all files into Docker container when in dev-mode.
- Removed the --harmony-proxies flag from npm test, as it is no longer supported by nodejs.
- Eliminate different markup warning between client/server during dev
